# Experimental Virtual DOM Implementation *(Under Construction)*

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This project is an experimental virtual DOM implementation created for *educational purposes*. Please note that this is an ongoing work-in-progress, and it is not a fully complete or entirely accurate representation of a virtual DOM.

The primary objective of this repository is to learn and explore the concepts behind virtual DOM and its implementation. As such, you might encounter bugs, limitations, or incomplete features.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment, and learn from it. If you find any issues or have suggestions, I appreciate your feedback. Let's learn and grow together as we build this virtual DOM implementation step by step.

Please remember that this repository is not suitable for production use, as it is still in development. You may want to refer to established libraries for robust virtual DOM implementations.

**Happy coding and learning!**
